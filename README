tr.im URLs
==========
The tr.im URLs system is divided into three different Rails applications that run indepdently of each other:

-- The tr.im website for URL creation, account management and statistics presentation
-- The tr.im API
-- The tr.im redirection system

These are currently hosted in SVN while I get around to making the personal and painful adjustment to Git. I will eventually move the repositories to here so everyone can see new commits, but for now they are available in SVN:

-- TBA
-- TBA
-- svn://raven.nambu.com/trim_redirects

Anonymous users can read the repository but not yet make changes to it.
