tr.im URLs
==========
The tr.im URLs system is divided into three different Rails applications that run independently of each other:

-- The tr.im website for URL creation, account management and statistics presentation
-- The tr.im API
-- The tr.im redirection system

These applications are currently hosted in SVN on Nambu's network while I get around to making the personal and (very) painful adjustment to Git. I will eventually move the repositories to here so everyone can see new commits, but for now they are available in SVN for your viewing and forking pleasure.

-- TBA
-- TBA
-- svn://raven.nambu.com/trim_redirects

Anonymous users can read the repositories.

By splitting tr.im into three applications we can all safely make updates to any one section that does not affect the others. Resources can be allocated based on demand to each based on what's required.

The first one for the tr.im website hosts all models and shared plugin code such that all three applications can access without serious headaches, gems or separate plugin repositories by symbolically linking to trim/vendor/plugins from the API and redirection applications, creating a shared plugins directory. Therefore you need the trim application to run the redirection and API applications.

All tr.im applications are currently at Rails v2.3.4. tr.im does not following some of the common Rails conventions, especially as it pertains to database management. tr.im uses database foreign key constraints to ensure database integrity, trading that for the ease of schema management. Therefore, many of the standard db rake tasks will therefore not work with tr.im.

To setup trim for the first time you will need to create your down database.yml file which we currently link from /etc/trim_db.yml. You will also need to update the config/config.yml which I have used to set application-wide constants. Also, update the environment files as you prefer for the caching store you prefer, and its location, if applicable.

To get started, after your configuration updates and dataase user setup, in the trim Rails directory run:

  rake trim:setup

There are other tr.im rake tasks for various features as well, such as tr.im URL Claiming.


The Roadmap
===========
Initially, the idea is to have people use the tr.im instance for their own purposes, and fork and extend it if they so choose for service under their own domain names. There are many features that have placeholders in place that just need to be added. I would like also to see development continue under tr.im with the following priorities:

-- New API methods for accessing URL shortening and click data in real-time with notifications
-- Addition of real-time chart updates using a Rack application and thin server set
-- New API for tr.im URLs and statistics that is properly RESTful, with better statistics access
-- New API methods to take notifications of shortenings of any tr.im-based shortener and publish them in real-time

And anything else the community needs and wants. I will continue to work on tr.im as I can. I also will be adding some additional items that we need for Nambu, when the time comes.

Adding and working on these features under tr.im will not have the same impact now that the tr.im is damaged, probably fatally. A new better domain name can take the take platform, and we can extend it together to offer more choice and options other than bit.ly, which really does not serve novice users very well. 


The Network Configuration
=========================
To distribute incoming requests to the appropriate Rails applicaiton I use HAProxy. It screens requests based on the path name and sends it to the appropraite server set. I currently have two servers for each application (bigger ones for redirections) such that I can push out updates with no disruption. You do not need to use HAProxy, but you will need something at the front end to distribute the requests based on the requested path.

The HAProxy configuration for tr.im is as follows:
